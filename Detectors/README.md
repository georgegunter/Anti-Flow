# Detectors:

Different trained detector models are stored here. 

## Recreating results from papers:

Models trained for us in "Compromised ACC vehicles can degrade current mixed-autonomy traffic performance while remaining stealthy against detection." are found in \Recreate_Paper_Results\Full_Network_Detectors\Speed_Based_Detectors.
