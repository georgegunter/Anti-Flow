The `Experiment` object expects 10 total arguments for the simulation configuration, which can be largely categorized into 2 types : *network* arguments, and *environment* arguments. **Network Arguments** describe the features of the transportation network used in simulation which includes properties of vehicles, traffic lights, inflows, etc. in the network. **Environment Arguments** deal with initializing and advancing simulations, and well as storing the simulation data for later use. Moreover, custom environments may be used to modify the dynamical features of a network. Below is a visual breakdown of the needed parameters.
