# Anti-Flow
This repository is built on and extends the [Flow software package](https://github.com/flow-project/flow) to explore cyber-security attacks on intelligent transportation systems. Where Flow is focused on how sparesely adopted AVs can improve traffic, this repository explores the opposite question: How can sparsely cyber-compromised AVs be used to degrade traffic flow?

## Getting started

To recreate simulations from "Compromised ACC vehicles can degrade current mixed-autonomy traffic performance while remaining stealthy against detection." run \examples\full_network_attack.py to create attacked traffic.

For a guide on how to set up an adversarial simulation environment see \tutorials.

## Installing flow

Follow these [installation instructions](
https://flow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/flow_setup.html) to install Flow.
