    "\n",
    "In order for an attack to be executed a model for how attacking vehicles should behave. In Anti-Flow this is done by taking advantage of the controller class in Flow, which specifies different components for how vehicles driver. In this tutorial we present the basic architecture for writing a car-following controller and then a lane-changing controller. We then implement simple adversarial controllers of those types, which we then simulate attacking a traffic flow."
