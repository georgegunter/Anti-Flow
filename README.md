# Anti-Flow
This repositoiry is built on the [Flow software package](https://github.com/flow-project/flow) to explore cyber-security attacks on intelligent transportation systems. Where Flow is focused on how sparesely adopted AVs can improve traffic, this repository explores the opposite question: How can sparsely cyber-compromised AVs be used to degrade traffic flow?
